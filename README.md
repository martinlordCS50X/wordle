# wordle
## Introdution
I created this project mostly for fun, but also to give other programmers a toolset for Wordle applications. I wish to create many obscure and useful tools, modules, functions, quality of life components, and much more. I also want to make a fun Wordle game for if you don't want to use the app or New York Times' website, for some reason. Here, you can have all that! Currently, /wordle includes a minimalistic Wordle game that includes everything 		that normal Wordle has, plus the option to pick a date instead of today's puzzle. Later, I will include /programmer_toolbox, which will include a much more fleshed out and better version of the original Wordle game I made, and a bunch of modules organized in a way for other programmers to understand. A lot later down the road, I will turn this all into a website.
