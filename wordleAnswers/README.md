# wordle
## Introdution
Wordle is a fun word puzzle game, owned by The New York Times. It is known for its daily puzzle solutions.
This project aims to create a big set of tools related to wordle, such as the api, the base game, extra features,
looking up solutions to different dates, and much more. Soon, this project will grow into a website, but, like most
other projects, it will have humble beginnings. For now, enjoy my helpers.py module and an nyt.api module, for other
programmers wishing to create wordle related projects, and the base game (accessible through main.py).
## Dependencies
You may use a virtual environment (I used venv to work on this) or something different to install these dependencies.
First, clone this repository to your computer using
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/wordle.git.
Then, install the required packages from PIP using
pip install requests colorama pyenchant.
Finally, assuming you have python installed, 
python main.py.
